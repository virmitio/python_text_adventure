## Python Adventure

This was written as an example and teaching aid for a Summer "Intro to programming (using Python)" course.
The request made of me was to produce a simple console text adventure with 4+ "rooms", at least one object to interact with, and an achievable "win" condition, in Python (a language I had no practical experience with).
The result of this is found in `python_adventure.py`.

I was also asked to roughly document or describe my process for use in the class.  These notes, in largely unedited form, are the contents of `python_adventure.md`, and include brief notes on time spent on major parts of the development process.

As my design intent was for the text adventure to be easily extensible, I'm making the code and what commit history I have of the development process available for future teaching and learning efforts.
